# 📠 RISC-V Programming

## Prerequisite

Download [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars) 1.5 (you need a Java runtime) [here](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars/releases/download/v1.5/rars1_5.jar).

## Workshop (Deadline: May 9, 2020)

Objective: Discovery of assembler programming using RISC-V and RARS simulation software.

The exercises will guide you through the manipulation of instructions, registers, the use of syscall, jumps, and conditional jumps to loops.

The exercises are ordered by increasing difficulty.

Fork this repository, open the `exercises` subfolder, answer questions directly inside the code comments, and complete each `.asm` file.
